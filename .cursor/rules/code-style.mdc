# üé® Cursor Rule: Code Style

This rule defines the preferred **coding style** for the `vibe-news` project, ensuring consistency, clarity, and maintainability across all Python files.

---

## ‚úÖ General Style

- Prioritize **clarity and readability** over cleverness or brevity.
- Use `snake_case` for functions and variables.
- Use `PascalCase` for class names.
- Include **type hints** for all functions and method signatures.
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces).
- Limit line length to **100 characters** where possible.
- Keep files under **300 lines**; refactor if growing beyond that.

---

## üßº Clean Code Practices

- Remove dead code, commented-out blocks, and unused imports.
- Group imports into:
  1. Standard library
  2. Third-party packages
  3. Internal modules
  ...with one blank line between groups.
- Use **docstrings** for all public functions, classes, and modules.
- Prefer f-strings over other string formatting methods.
- Avoid deeply nested logic when possible ‚Äî flatten conditionals and extract helper functions.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Function & Module Behavior

- Functions should **do one thing well** and be named accordingly.
- Avoid side effects in utility functions unless explicitly intended.
- Raise specific exceptions, not generic `Exception`.

---

## üß† Cursor-Specific Notes

- Only modify code style if the changes clearly improve readability and follow the above rules.
- When in doubt, **ask before making nontrivial stylistic rewrites**.
